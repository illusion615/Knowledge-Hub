1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
First,

2
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:02,839
we need to create

3
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:03,980
a Blob Storage

4
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,540
Account in Azure.

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:09,519
Please make sure that

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,480
when you create a account,

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,539
you will follow

8
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:14,439
the steps in the

9
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:14,439
video description.

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,399
In the process of

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,219
the Blob resource preparation,

12
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,579
do not close the

13
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,280
current interface.

14
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,160
Next,

15
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,219
we need to reopen

16
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,359
an Azure window

17
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,500
and start to deploy

18
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,539
Azure Functions.

19
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:33,880
Please make sure

20
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,600
that when you create,

21
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:35,759
you will follow

22
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,619

24
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,259
Be careful to choose

25
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:45,600
Python and the

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,420
largest instance size.

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,140
When you wait for

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,619

29
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:00,140

the environment,

190
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:42,259
you need to allow

Pages to start creating,

206
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,759
we go back to VS

207
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,240
Studio and check if the

208
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,259
function app has been

209
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:09,579
successfully deployed.

210
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,959
If there is a

211
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,660
no-htt

212
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:14,160
p-triggers

213
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,480
found in the image,

214
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,459
we need to do the

215
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,680
same step again.

216
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,860
That is, click the

217
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,420
Cloud button again,

218
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,180
select the function

219
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,300
app and wait

220
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,819
for confirmation.

221
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,560
Then, we can create

222
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,279
the PowerPages.

223
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:19,680
We can create

224
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,259
the PowerPages.

225
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:20,480

stop at this interface.

229
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,660
When the file is

230
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,079
installed and the

231
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,620
solution is solved,

232
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,420
we will use these

233
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,819
information.

234
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,120
Next,

235
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:33,699
we go back to

236
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:34,579
Azure Blob,

237
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:34,920
the interface that

238
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,500
does not belong

239
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:35,779
to the resources.

Add a name for the

243
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:42,459
container and allow it to

244
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,139
be password-respected.

245
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,259
Click the Access Keys

246
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:57,740

stop at this interface.

248
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,220
When the file is

249
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,600
installed and the

250
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,139
solution is solved,

251
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:02,680
we will use these

252
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:02,779
information.

253
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:05,519
Next,

254
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:06,959
we go back to the

255
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,740
PowerApps interface

256
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740

are successfully entered,

364
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:44,419
we need to check

365
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,980
if the flow in each

366
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,840

379
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,120
After checking

380
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,279
all the flow,

381
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,919
we need to click on
